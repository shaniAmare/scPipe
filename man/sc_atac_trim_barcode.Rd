\arguments{
\item{r1}{read one for pair-end reads.}

\item{r2}{read two for pair-end reads, NULL if single read.}

\item{bc_file}{the barcode information, can be either in a \code{fastq} format (e.g. from 10x-ATAC) or
from a \core{.csv} file (here the barcode is expected to be on the second column). 
Currently, for the fastq approach, this can be a list of barcode files.}

\item{output_folder}{the output dir for the demultiplexed fastq file, which will contain 
fastq files with reformatted barcode and UMI into the read name. 
Files ending in \code{.gz} will be automatically compressed.}

\item{bc_start}{barcode start position (0-indexed), which is an extra parameter that is needed if the
\code{bc_file} is in a \code{.csv} format.}

\item{bc_length}{barcode length, which is an extra parameter that is needed if the
\code{bc_file} is in a \code{.csv} format.}

\item{umi_start}{if available, the start position of the molecular identifier.}

\item{umi_length}{if available, the start position of the molecular identifier.}

\item{rmN}{logical, whether to remove reads that contains N in UMI or cell barcode.}

\item{rmlow}{logical, whether to remove the low quality reads.}

\item{min_qual}{the minimum base pair quality that is allowed.}

\item{num_below_min}{the maximum number of base pairs below the quality threshold.}
}
\description{
single-cell data need to be demultiplexed in order to retain the information of the cell barcodes
the data belong to. Here we reformat fastq files so barcode/s (and if available the UMI sequences) are moved from
the sequence into the read name. Since scATAC-Seq data are mostly paired-end, both `r1` and `r2` are demultiplexed in this function.
